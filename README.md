# 🇮🇳 India Infrastructure Development: Case Study & Data Analysis

This repository presents a detailed case study and data analysis on **India's infrastructure development**, focusing on sectors such as transportation, energy, urbanization, and smart cities. It aims to explore growth patterns, investments, and regional development using public datasets and visualizations.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze and visualize infrastructure development in India over the past two decades with respect to:

- Road and railway expansion
- Energy (Electricity generation and renewable adoption)
- Urban infrastructure & Smart Cities Mission
- State-wise investment patterns and development disparities

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (for data extraction and querying)
- **Power BI / Tableau** (for visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for analysis)
- **Excel** (data preprocessing)

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📚 Data Sources
